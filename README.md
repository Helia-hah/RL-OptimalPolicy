# RL-OptimalPolicy
In this project, two Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Policy Iteration and Value Iteration) were developed to obtain the optimal policy. The implemented alhorithms were evaluated on a gridworld environment. <br />

This issue is a continuing task with zero reward everywhere except for a reward of +1 when landing on the goal state/cell. <br />

The policy Iteration algorithm was developed based on following pseudo-code:
